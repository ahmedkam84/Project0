      <p>Strictly speaking, the use of the name
“Assyria” for the period before the latter
half of the second millennium BC is
anachronistic. Assyria—as against the
city-state of Ashur—did not become an
independent state until about 1400 BC.</p>
      <p>In contrast to southern Mesopotamia
or the mid-Euphrates region (Mari), written
sources in Assyria do not begin until
very late, shortly before Ur III. By
Assyria—a region that does not lend itself
to precise geographic delineation—is
understood the territory on the Tigris
north of the river’s passage through the
mountains of the Jabal H· amrīn to a point
north of Nineveh, as well as the area
between Little and Great Zab (a tributary of the Tigris in northeast Iraq) and to the
north of the latter. </p>
      <p> In the north, Assyria
was later bordered by the mountain state
of Urartu; to the east and southeast its
neighbour was the region around ancient
Nuzu (near modern Kirkūk, “Arrapchitis”
[Arrapkha] of the Greeks). In the early
second millennium the main cities of this
region were Ashur (160 miles [257 km]
north-northwest of modern Baghdad), the
capital (synonymous with the city god
and national divinity); Nineveh, lying
opposite modern Mosul; and Urbilum,
later Arbela (modern Irbīl, some 200
miles [322 km] north of Baghdad).</p>
