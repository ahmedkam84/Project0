      <p>During the collapse of Ur III, Ishbi-Erra established himself
in Isin and founded a dynasty there that lasted from 2017
to 1794. His example was followed elsewhere by local rulers,
as in Dēr, Eshnunna, Sippar, Kish, and Larsa. In many localities
an urge was felt to imitate the model of Ur; Isin probably
took over unchanged the administrative system of that state.</p>
      <p>Ishbi-Erra and his successors had themselves deifi ed, as did
one of the rulers of Dēr, on the Iranian border. For almost a
century Isin predominated within the mosaic of states that
were slowly reemerging. Overseas trade revived after Ishbi-
Erra had driven out the Elamite garrison from Ur, and under
his successor, Shu-ilishu, a statue of the moon god Nanna, the
city god of Ur, was recovered from the Elamites.</p>
      <p>Up to the reign of Lipit-Ishtar ( c. 1934– c. 1924), the rulers
of Isin so resembled those of Ur, as far as the king’s assessment
of himself in the hymns is concerned, that it seems
almost arbitrary to postulate a break between Ibbi-Sin and
Ishbi-Erra. As a further example of continuity it might be
added that the Code of Lipit-Ishtar stands exactly midway
chronologically between the Code of Ur-Nammu and the
Code of Hammurabi. Yet it is much closer to the former in
language and especially in legal philosophy than to
Hammurabi’s compilation of judgments. For example, the
Code of Lipit-Ishtar does not know the lex talionis (“an eye
for an eye and a tooth for a tooth”), the guiding principle of
Hammurabi’s penal law. </p>
