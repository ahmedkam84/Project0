      <p>The earliest known civilization was that of Sumer, located
in the southernmost part of Mesopotamia between the
Tigris and the Euphrates rivers, in the area that later became
Babylonia and is now southern Iraq covering the region
roughly from Baghdad to the Persian Gulf.</p>

      <p>Sumer was fi rst settled between 4500 and 4000 BC by a
non-Semitic people who did not speak the Sumerian language.
These people now are called proto-Euphrateans or
Ubaidians, for the village Al-â€˜Ubayd, where their remains
were fi rst discovered. The Ubaidians were the fi rst civilizing
force in Sumer, draining the marshes for agriculture, developing
trade, and establishing industries, including weaving,
leatherwork, metalwork, masonry, and pottery. After the
Ubaidian immigration to Mesopotamia, various Semitic
peoples infi ltrated their territory, adding their cultures to
the Ubaidian culture, and creating a high pre-Sumerian
civilization.</p>

      <p>The people called Sumerians, whose language became
the prevailing language of the territory, probably came from
around Anatolia, arriving in Sumer about 3300 BC . By the
third millennium BC the country was the site of at least 12
separate city-states: Kish, Erech (Uruk), Ur, Sippar, Akshak,
Larak, Nippur, Adab, Umma, Lagash, Bad-tibira, and Larsa.
Each of these states was comprised of a walled city and its
surrounding villages and land, and each worshiped its own
deity, whose temple was the central structure of the city. </p>
