      <h2> Introduction</h2>
      <p id="about-content">In the narrow sense, Mesopotamia is the area between the
Euphrates and Tigris rivers, north or northwest of the bottleneck
at Baghdad, in modern Iraq; it is Al-Jazīrah (“The
Island”) of the Arabs. South of this lies Babylonia, named
after the city of Babylon. However, in the broader sense, the
name "Mesopotamia" has come to be used for the area
bounded on the northeast by the Zagros Mountains and on
the southwest by the edge of the Arabian Plateau and stretching
from the Persian Gulf in the southeast to the spurs of the Anti-Taurus Mountains in the northwest.
Only from the latitude of Baghdad do the
Euphrates and Tigris truly become twin
rivers, the rāfidān of the Arabs, which
have constantly changed their courses
over the millennia. The low-lying plain of
the Kārūn River in Persia has always been
closely related to Mesopotamia, but it is
not considered part of Mesopotamia as it
forms its own river system.
Mesopotamia, south of Al-Ramādī
(about 70 miles, or 110 kilometres, west of
Baghdad) on the Euphrates and the bend
of the Tigris below Sāmarrā’ (about 70
miles north-northwest of Baghdad), is flat
alluvial land. Between Baghdad and the
mouth of the Shat·
t·
al-‘Arab (the confluence
of the Tigris and Euphrates, where it
empties into the Persian Gulf) there is a
difference in height of only about 100
feet (30 metres). As a result of the slow
flow of the water, there are heavy deposits
of silt, and the riverbeds are raised.
Consequently, the rivers often overflow
their banks (and may even change their
course) when they are not protected by
high dikes. In recent times they have
been regulated above Baghdad by the
use of escape channels with overflow reservoirs.
The extreme south is a region of
extensive marshes and reed swamps,
hawrs, which, probably since early times,
have served as an area of refuge for
oppressed and displaced peoples.
